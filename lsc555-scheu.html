		<h1>Things I never expected to do as a Library Director</h1>
		<h2>by Cindy Scheu</h2>
		<h3>Library Director</h3>
		<p> There are many things I expected to do as a Library Director, but so far there are many more things I never expected to have to do. Small, rural public libraries offer you the chance to be a part of the community and sometimes that means as a librarian you end up doing things you never expected to have to do, such as:

		<ul>
			<li>Knowing how to trim a Japanese Maple</li>
			<li>Painting a bathroom</li>
			<li>Having to file a police report for theft</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Even with the strange and sometimes off the wall things I have to do, I still love being a librarian.
